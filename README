-----------------------
- corrected a multi-threading issue
- changed from using DrawableCircles array to a synchronized list
- renamed "WTF" mode to "Seizure Mode"
- changed some seizure mode logic
- deleted Main Activity. Application has pretty much always launched directly into the game activity, so no need to keep the old main activity around.
- removed "drop" drawable resource (used in main activity)
- removed "gravity" drawable resource (not used)


initial commit
-----------------------
